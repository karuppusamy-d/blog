You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Extend / Customize

`data/siteMetadata.json` - contains most of the site related information which should be modified for a user's need.

`data/projectsData.js` - data used to generate styled card in projects page.

`data/headerNavLinks.js` - navigation links.

`data/logo.svg` - replace with your own logo.

`data/blog` - replace with your own blog posts.

`public/static` - store assets such as images and favicons.

`css/tailwind.css` - contains the tailwind stylesheet which can be modified to change the overall look and feel of the site.

`components/social-icons` - to add other icons, simply copy an svg file from [Simple Icons](https://simpleicons.org/) and map them in `index.js`. Other icons uses [heroicons](https://heroicons.com/).

`components/MDXComponents.js` - pass your own JSX code or React component by specifying it over here. You can then call them directly in the `.mdx` or `.md` file. By default, a custom link and image component is passed.

`pages` - pages to route to. Read the [Next.js documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) for more information

## Post

### Frontmatter

Frontmatter follows [Hugo's standards](https://gohugo.io/content-management/front-matter/).

Currently 7 fields are supported.

```
title (required)
date (required)
tags (required, can be empty array)
lastmod (optional)
draft (optional)
summary (optional)
images (optional, if none provided defaults to socialBanner in siteMetadata config)
```

Here's an example of a post's frontmatter:

```
---
title: 'Introducing Tailwind Nexjs Starter Blog'
date: '2021-01-12'
lastmod: '2021-01-18'
tags: ['next-js', 'tailwind', 'guide']
draft: false
summary: 'Looking for a performant, out of the box template, with all the best in web technology to support your blogging needs? Checkout the Tailwind Nextjs Starter Blog template.'
images: ['/static/images/canada/mountains.jpg', '/static/images/canada/toronto.jpg']
---
```

### Compose

`scripts/compose.js` can be used to easily generate a post with pre-filled front matter.

The first argument is the name of the post and the second optional argument is the extension (default to .mdx)

Example code to generate the post called "My First Post" in markdown format

```
node ./scripts/compose.js "My First Post" .md
```

This will generate `./data/blog/my-first-post.md` with pre-filled front matter.
