    title: "HiFi Stereo Amplifier Using TDA7292 IC",
    description: `I designed a HiFi Stereo Amplifier based of TDA7292 IC, which can provide up-to 40W+40W power output. It is a 10cm*10cm PCB. Mostly I used Metal Film, Mica and Ceramic Capacitors, So It can deliver High Quality sound. I have also Isolated High Power Components with Low Power Components to reduce noise. It also has a Mute and Standby circuits for effectively reduce power when not in use.`,

    title: "Water Level Monitor & Controller",
    description: `It is based on ESP32 / NodeMCU and contains Ultrasonic Sensor and a Relay. It automatically controls water pump and fills the tanks when empty. It can be used in houses or elevated reservoirs. It integrates with Google Assistant and Specially designed Android App, So we can monitor and control water tanks through Mobile app Website or Google Assistant anytime anywhere. It's cost is very low because of fewer components.`,
